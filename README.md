# Grammar Analyzer

This project is a grammar analyzer built in React, designed to parse context-free grammars (CFG) and construct parsing tables. It supports functionalities such as removing left recursion, calculating FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and building the predictive parsing table (M Table).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Grammar Format
Grammars should be defined in a `.txt` file with each production on a new line. Hereâ€™s an example:

- E -> E + T
- E -> T
- T -> T * F
- T -> F
- F -> i
